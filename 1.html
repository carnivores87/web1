Well, they say people come
The say people go
This <strong>particular <u>diamond</u> was extra special</strong>
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">celestial</a>
And I should but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, when I'm cold
Cold

<p style="margin-top:45px;">
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow
Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And I'm gonna miss you, I know
But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because, I live for this feeling, this everglow
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you gave me will everglow
